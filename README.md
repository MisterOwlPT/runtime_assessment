Developing a tool to perform runtime assessment of industrial robotics applications. This project combines dynamic verification and real-time assessments in a CI/CD pipeline. The tool evaluates adherence to functional requirements, focusing on dynamic aspects like sensor data integration and service level agreements. The goal is to ensure robustness, performance, and reliability when deploying ROS applications on physical robots in real-world scenarios.
